### Hey folks :D

I'm Mahdi Hashemi, 19 y.o, a guy who loves computers and... about me:

- I'm really interested in open-source projects and love to contribute to them :)

- The language I'm learning is **JavaScript**

- I'm learning JS to work with Node.js, and not to be a front-end developer (I'm tooooo lazy for front)

- The next languages I like to learn are Python and Go, but when? Who knows? `\_(o_0)_/`

- I like math. It's cool

- I have a mate named Computer. We're friends since i was an 8 year-old boy. We still have fun with each other :D

- You can contact me via email if you want: mahdihashemiii939 gmail com

I guess that's it for now. Have a nice day/night :)
