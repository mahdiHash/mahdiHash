### hey folks :D

i'm mahdi hashemi, 18 y.o, a guy who loves computer and here are some... about me:

- i'm now working on nothing special. maybe it's because i'm still learning to code

- i'm really interested in open source projects and love to contribute to them :)

- the language i'm learning is **javascript**

- i'm learning js to work with node.js, and not to be a front-end developer (i'm tooooo lazy for front)

- the next languages i like to learn are python and golang, but when? who knows? `\_(o_0)_/`

- i'm looking for help with finding miniprojects for practice, although i think when i learn more, this will be solved  
(but seriously: find some practice for beck-end is much harder than front)

- i'm lazy to use shift key, "y" key (bothers me), ctrl key, f1..f12 keys. *But I will use them if I have to*

- i like math. not "love" it, just like it. it's cool

- i have a mate named computer. we're friends since i was a 8 year-old boy. we still have fun with each other :D

- i'm not good at socializing, it's really hard :/

- you can contact me via email if you want: mahdihashemiii939@gmail.com

i guess that's it for now. have a nice day/night :)
