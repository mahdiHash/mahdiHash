### Hey folks :D

I'm Mahdi Hashemi, 21 y.o, a guy who loves computers and... about me:

- I'm really interested in open-source projects and love to contribute to them :)

- I know JavaScript and TypeScript,

- I use JS and TS to develop apps with Node.js and not to be a front-end developer (I'm tooooo lazy for front),

- The languages I like to learn next are Python and Go, but when? Who knows? `\_(o_0)_/`,

- I like math. It's cool,

- I have a mate named Computer. We're friends since I was an 8 year-old boy. We still have fun with each other :D

I guess that's all for now. Have a nice day/night :)
